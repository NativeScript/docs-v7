## Class: "ui/core/view".View  
_Inherits:_ [_ProxyObject_](../../../ui/core/proxy/ProxyObject.md)  
_Conform to:_ [_ApplyXmlAttributes_](../../../ui/core/view/ApplyXmlAttributes.md)  
This class is the base class for all UI components. 
A View occupies a rectangular area on the screen and is responsible for drawing and layouting of all UI components within.

##### Instance Functions
 - **measure(** widthMeasureSpec _Number_, heightMeasureSpec _Number_ **)**  
     This is called to find out how big a view should be. The parent supplies constraint information in the width and height parameters.
The actual measurement work of a view is performed in onMeasure(int, int), called by this method. Therefore, only onMeasure(int, int) can and must be overridden by subclasses.
   - **widthMeasureSpec** - _Number_  
     Horizontal space requirements as imposed by the parent
   - **heightMeasureSpec** - _Number_  
     Vertical space requirements as imposed by the parent
 - **layout(** left _Number_, top _Number_, right _Number_, bottom _Number_ **)**  
     Assign a size and position to a view and all of its descendants
This is the second phase of the layout mechanism. (The first is measuring). In this phase, each parent calls layout on all of its children to position them. This is typically done using the child measurements that were stored in the measure pass().
Derived classes should not override this method. Derived classes with children should override onLayout. In that method, they should call layout on each of their children.
   - **left** - _Number_
   - **top** - _Number_
   - **right** - _Number_
   - **bottom** - _Number_
 - **getMeasuredWidth()** _Number_  
     Returns the raw width component.
   - _**return**_ - _Number_
 - **getMeasuredHeight()** _Number_  
     Returns the raw height component.
   - _**return**_ - _Number_
 - **requestLayout()**  
     Call this when something has changed which has invalidated the layout of this view. This will schedule a layout pass of the view tree.
 - **onMeasure(** widthMeasureSpec _Number_, heightMeasureSpec _Number_ **)**  
     Measure the view and its content to determine the measured width and the measured height. This method is invoked by measure(int, int) and should be overriden by subclasses to provide accurate and efficient measurement of their contents.
When overriding this method, you must call setMeasuredDimension(int, int) to store the measured width and height of this view. Failure to do so will trigger an exception, thrown by measure(int, int).
   - **widthMeasureSpec** - _Number_  
     horizontal space requirements as imposed by the parent. The requirements are encoded with View.MeasureSpec.
   - **heightMeasureSpec** - _Number_  
     vertical space requirements as imposed by the parent. The requirements are encoded with View.MeasureSpec.
 - **onLayout(** left _Number_, top _Number_, right _Number_, bottom _Number_ **)**  
     Called from layout when this view should assign a size and position to each of its children. Derived classes with children should override this method and call layout on each of their children.
   - **left** - _Number_  
     Left position, relative to parent
   - **top** - _Number_  
     Top position, relative to parent
   - **right** - _Number_  
     Right position, relative to parent
   - **bottom** - _Number_  
     Bottom position, relative to parent
 - **setMeasuredDimension(** measuredWidth _Number_, measuredHeight _Number_ **)**  
     This method must be called by onMeasure(int, int) to store the measured width and measured height. Failing to do so will trigger an exception at measurement time.
   - **measuredWidth** - _Number_  
     The measured width of this view. May be a complex bit mask as defined by MEASURED_SIZE_MASK and MEASURED_STATE_TOO_SMALL.
   - **measuredHeight** - _Number_  
     The measured height of this view. May be a complex bit mask as defined by MEASURED_SIZE_MASK and MEASURED_STATE_TOO_SMALL.
