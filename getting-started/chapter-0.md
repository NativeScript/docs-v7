## NativeScript Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) getting started guide. In this guided tutorial you'll use NativeScript, a cross-platform JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps, to build an iOS and Android app from scratch.

> **TIP:** For a video introduction to NativeScript, see the [getting started guide on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsCT5fpES4Q).

## What you're building

This guide will walk you through building [Groceries](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries), a groceries management app that does the following things:

- Connects to an existing RESTful service.
- Lets users to register and login.
- Lets authenticated users to add and delete groceries from a list.
- Runs cross-platform (iOS and Android).

If you follow along to the end, here's what the finished app will look like on iOS:

And here's what the app will look like on Android:
