# Chapter 7—Next Steps

Sadly our tutorial is now complete, but your journey with NativeScript is just beginning. Let’s look at the next steps you can take to build your next app with NativeScript.

## 7.1: Join the NativeScript community

Regardless of what you choose to do next with NativeScript, joining the NativeScript community is a great way to keep up with the latest and greatest in the NativeScript world. Here are some ways you can get involved:

- **Follow [@nativescript](https://twitter.com/nativescript) on Twitter** for updates on all things NativeScript.
- **Sign up for the [NativeScript newsletter](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-newsletter)**. The newsletter will deliver NativeScript articles, news, plugin updates, and more straight to your inbox.
- **Join the [NativeScript Community Slack](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation)**. The community Slack is a great place to chat with others in the NativeScript community.

## 7.2: Start your own app

Although you’re welcome to use Groceries as the basis of your own app, if you want to start a new app from scratch, the NativeScript CLI provides a number of built-in starting points. For example, you can start a new “hello world” app by running the `tns create` command:

```
tns create MyNextGreatApp
```

If you want to start from a slightly more complete starting point, the `tns create` command also has a `--template` option that lets you start from a variety of pre-built templates. For instance, the following command creates a NativeScript project with tab navigation already setup.

```
tns create MyNextGreatApp --template tns-template-tab-navigation
```

> **TIP**: A number of other templates are available to use with the `--template` option, including TypeScript templates and more. Refer to [the full list of official templates](https://www.tjvantoll.com/2016/02/22/creating-nativescript-templates/) at any time.

Regardless of which template you choose to start from, once you have your app up and running, let’s look at some of the resources you can use as you develop.

## 7.3: Bookmark NativeScript learning resources

There is a variety of NativeScript learning material that goes above and beyond what was offered in this tutorial. You may wish to refer to any of the following as you take your app from a prototype to the app stores:

- The NativeScript team provides a series of [real-world app samples](https://www.nativescript.org/app-samples-with-code) that are all open source on GitHub. These samples are great to reference as you’re developing your application.
    - The NativeScript kitchen sink demo app shows off what NativeScript is capable of, and therefore is a great reference when you’re trying to implement a particular UI. You can refer to [its code on GitHub](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-marketplace-demo), or [download the app from the iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/examples-nativescript/id1046772499?ls=1&mt=8), or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.nativescriptmarketplacedemo&amp;hl=en), to see the app in action. 
- The [NativeScript resources page](https://www.nativescript.org/resources) lists further NativeScript learning material, such as training, books, and screencasts.
- [NativeScript Snacks](http://www.nativescriptsnacks.com/) is a collection of bite-sized video tutorials—perfect for learning how a NativeScript concept works quickly.
- This NativeScript documentation site has detailed guides on topics that were out of scope for this guide, including [unit testing](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/testing), [debugging](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/debugging), [transpiling Babel or TypeScript code](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/transpilers), and [publishing to the iOS App Store](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/publishing-ios-apps) and [Google Play](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/publishing-android-apps).

## 7.4: Let us know what you think

Finally, we’d love if you could take a minute to tell us what you thought about the this guide. Your feedback helps us make this tutorial better.
