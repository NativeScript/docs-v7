## 7.1: Join the NativeScript community

Regardless of what you choose to do next with NativeScript, joining the NativeScript community is a great way to keep up with the latest and greatest in the NativeScript world. Here are some ways you can get involved:

- **Follow [@nativescript](https://twitter.com/nativescript) on Twitter** for updates on all things NativeScript.
- **Sign up for the [NativeScript newsletter](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-newsletter)**. The newsletter will deliver NativeScript articles, news, plugin updates, and more straight to your inbox.
- **Join the [NativeScript Community Slack](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation)**. The community Slack is a great place to chat with others in the NativeScript community.

## 7.2: Start your own app

Although you’re welcome to use Groceries as the basis of your own app, if you want to start a new app from scratch, the NativeScript CLI provides a `--ng` option for starting apps with TypeScript and Angular preconfigured. For example, the following command creates an app named “MyNextGreatApp”:

```
tns create MyNextGreatApp --ng
```

Once you have your app up and running, let’s look at some of the resources you can use as you develop.

## 7.3: Bookmark NativeScript learning resources

There are a variety of NativeScript learning materials that go above and beyond what was offered in this tutorial. You may wish to refer to any of the following as you take your app from a prototype to the app stores:

- The NativeScript team provides a series of [real-world app samples](https://www.nativescript.org/app-samples-with-code) that are all open source on GitHub. These samples are great to reference as you’re developing your application.
- The [NativeScript code samples reference](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/code-samples/overview) contains a number of copy and paste friendly examples for building your user interface.
- The [NativeScript resources page](https://www.nativescript.org/resources) lists further NativeScript learning material, such as training, books, and screencasts.
- [NativeScript Snacks](http://www.nativescriptsnacks.com/) is a collection of bite-sized video tutorials—perfect for learning how a NativeScript concept works quickly.
- The NativeScript documentation site has detailed guides on topics that were out of scope for this guide, including [unit testing](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/testing), [debugging](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/debugging), [transpiling Babel or TypeScript code](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/transpilers), and [publishing to the iOS App Store](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/publishing-ios-apps) and [Google Play](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/publishing-android-apps).

## 7.4: Let us know what you think
