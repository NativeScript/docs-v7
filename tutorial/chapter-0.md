# NativeScript Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the NativeScript Getting Started Guide. In this tutorial you'll use NativeScript, a cross-platform JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps, to build an iOS and Android app from scratch.

## 0.1: What is NativeScript?

  <p><a href="https://www.nativescript.org/">NativeScript</a> is a free and open source framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and CSS. NativeScript renders UIs with the native platform’s rendering engine—no <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-webview/">WebViews</a>—resulting in native-like performance and UX.</p>

NativeScript provides a best-of-both-worlds development experience. The NativeScript cross-platform JavaScript modules give you the convenience of writing iOS and Android apps from a single JavaScript codebase, while the NativeScript runtimes give you the power of accessing native APIs, SDKs, and frameworks when you need them—all without needing to open Xcode or Android Studio.

## 0.2: Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and your development machine’s terminal. More specifically:

* **JavaScript**: You should know basic JavaScript concepts, such as how functions, if statements, and loops work.
* **CSS**: You should know how to write simple CSS selectors, and know how to apply CSS rules as name/value pairs.
* **The terminal**: You should know how to open a terminal or command-line prompt on your development machine, how to change directories, and how to execute commands.
* **A text editor or IDE**: You should know the basics of your text editor or IDE of choice. You can use any text editor to build NativeScript apps.

## 0.3: Installation

If you have node v6, homebrew, jdk, and the android-sdk installed then you can get up and running with:

    npm install -g nativescript
    gem install cocoapods -V
    gem install xcodeproj -V

If you have not yet done any software development then you want to read more about setting up your environment in our [Complete the NativeScript installation guide](/start/quick-setup)

> **TIP**: Setting up your machine for native development can be tricky, especially if you’re new to mobile development. If you get stuck, or if you have questions while going through these instructions, the [NativeScript community forum](http://forum.nativescript.org/) is a great place to get help.

With that out of the way, let’s get started building apps with NativeScript!
