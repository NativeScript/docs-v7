# Overview
NativeScript uses a modular design pattern. All functionality that NativeScript offers resides in different modules. Modules divide code into clusters that, by a certain criterion, belong together. For example, UI views such as buttons and labels each reside in their own module separating them from the rest of the code. In order to use something that a module contains, one needs to **require** the module in his own code.

+ [application](./ApiReference/application/HOW-TO.md) - contains the application abstraction with all related methods.
+ [console](./ApiReference/console/HOW-TO.md) - allows printing messages to the device's console.
