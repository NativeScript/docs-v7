## Object: "ui/frame".AndroidFrame  
_Extends:_ [_Observable_](../../data/observable/Observable.md)  
Represents the Android-specific Frame object, aggregated within the common Frame one.
In Android there are two types of navigation - using new Activity instances or using Fragments within the main Activity.
To start a new Activity, a new Frame instance should be created and navigated to the desired Page.

 - **rootViewGroup** - _ViewGroup_.    
  Gets the native android.view.ViewGroup instance that represents the root layout part of the Frame.

  Gets the native android.app.Activity instance associated with this Frame. In case of nested Frame objects, this property points to the activity of the root Frame.
 - **currentActivity** - _Activity_.    
  Gets the current (foreground) activity for the application. This property will recursively traverse all existing Frame objects and check for own Activity property.
 - **actionBar** - _ActionBar_.    
  Gets the actionBar property of the currentActivity.
 - **showActionBar** - _Boolean_.    
  Determines whether the Activity associated with this Frame will display an action bar or not.
