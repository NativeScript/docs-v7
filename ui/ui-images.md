# Working with Images
In this article we will look in the different ways to show images in a NativeScript application.
Images are added to application either declaratively(XML) or with code(JS):

```XML
<Image src="~/logo.png" / >
```
```JavaScript
var image = new imageModule.Image();
image.src = "~/logo.png";
dockLayout.addChild(image);
```

The prefix of the `src` value specify where the image will be loaded form. The possible options are:

* [From URL (`http://` or `https://` prefix)](#load-images-from-url)
* [From local file system (`~/` prefix)](#load-images-from-local-file-system)
* [From resource (`res://` prefix)](#load-images-from-resource)

You can also use the [image-source]({{site.baseurl}}/ApiReference/image-source/HOW-TO.html) module to create an image source and manually set it to the image:
```JavaScript
var image = new imageModule.Image();
var imageSource = imageSourceModule.fromResource("logo");
image.imageSource = imageSource;
```

You can also use the [image-source API]({{site.baseurl}}/ApiReference/image-source/ImageSource.html) to save and load images form base64 encoded string.

## Load Images from URL
Web images have `http://` or `https://` prefix. When such image is loaded, an asynchronous http request will be sent and the image will be shown if the request is successful.
```XML
<Image src="https://www.google.com/images/errors/logo_sm_2.png" / >
```

You can manually create an [ImageSource instance from URL]({{site.baseurl}}/ApiReference/image-source/HOW-TO.html#load-image-from-url)

## Load Images from Local File System
Using the `~/` prefix you can load images relative to the `App` folder inside your project.

```XML
<Image src="~/images/logo.png" stretch ="none" / >
```

You can manually create an [ImageSource instance from local file]({{site.baseurl}}/ApiReference/image-source/HOW-TO.html#load-image-from-a-local-file)

> Currently loading images form the file system does not respect file-name qualifiers as described [here]({% slug architecture %}#supporting-multiple-screens). We have plans to implement that along with [density-specific qualifiers support.](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/276).

## Load Images from Resource
Using the `res://` prefix you can load resource image. This is the suggested approach, as it uses the native methods for loading the best image for the current device screen density.

```XML
<Image src="res://logo" stretch ="none" / >
```

You can manually create an [ImageSource instance from resource]({{site.baseurl}}/ApiReference/image-source/HOW-TO.html#load-image-using-resource-name)

> The file extension is not included when referencing resource images.

The actual resource images should be added to the `App_Resources` folder in you application and should follow the platform guidelines.

### Adding Android Resources
Android resources should be added to the corresponding `drawable-XXX` folders inside the `App_Resources\Android` folder in your app:

![android resources](../img/resources/android-resources.png "android resources")

The content of this directory will be copied inside the `platforms\android\res` when the app is prepared by the NativeScript CLI. More information about how drawable resources in android can be found [here](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#DesigningResources).

### Adding iOS Resources
IOS resources should be added inside the `App_Resources\ios` folder in your app. You can use `@1x`, `@2x` and `@3x` suffixes to target devices with a specific screen scale. Here is a list of devices that for each scale factor:

* **@1x** - iPad 2 and iPad mini (1st Generation)
* **@2x** - iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPad (retina)
* **@3x** - iPhone 6 Plus

For more information see [Icon and Image Sizes](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH27-SW1) in the iOS Developer Library.

Once the NativeScript project is prepared(`tns ios prepare`) all the images will be copied to the `platforms\ios\<project-name>\Resources`.

**iOS images must be `PNG` or `JPG` files**
