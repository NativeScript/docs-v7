# Set Up the NativeScript CLI on Linux

With the open-source [NativeScript Command-Line Interface][NativeScript CLI] and an IDE or text editor of your choice, you can create, develop, store and build your apps entirely locally, free of charge, without an Internet connection and anonymously.

On Linux systems, you can use the NativeScript CLI to develop only Android apps. This limitation is caused by the requirements for iOS development.
