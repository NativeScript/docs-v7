# Set Up the AppBuilder Command-Line Interface

With the [AppBuilder command-line interface](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder/command-line-interface) you can use the cloud services provided by AppBuilder paired with an IDE or text editor of your choice. If you are an avid Sublime Text user, you can pair the AppBuilder CLI with the [AppBuilder package for Sublime Text](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder/sublime-text-package).

With this IDE, you can develop for Android and iOS on Windows, OS X or Linux.
