# Set Up Your System

Before you can begin development with NativeScript, you need to choose your tool set and configure your system to use it.

When you develop with NativeScript, you can choose between a local tool set ([NativeScript Command-Line Interface][NativeScript CLI]) and a cloud tool set ([Telerik AppBuilder][AppBuilder]).

* [The NativeScript CLI](#the-nativescript-cli)
* [The AppBuilder Tool Set](#the-appbuilder-toolset)

## The NativeScript CLI

*Create, store, develop, build and test apps locally and free of charge on Windows, OS X or Ubuntu*

With the open-source [NativeScript Command-Line Interface][NativeScript CLI] and an IDE or text editor of your choice, you can create, develop, store and build your apps entirely locally, free of charge, without an Internet connection and anonymously.

To take advantage of this autonomy, you need to configure your system with the tools and SDKs for native development of the platforms for which you want to develop. The NativeScript CLI uses them to produce truly native builds of your cross-platform projects.

> **TIP:** If you are familiar with the Apache Cordova CLI, you might want to try the NativeScript CLI. It provides a similar set of commands and an identical experience.

* [Set Up on Windows](/ns-cli-setup/ns-setup-win.md)
* [Set Up on OS X](/ns-cli-setup/ns-setup-win.md)
* [Set Up on Linux](/ns-cli-setup/ns-setup-linux.md)

## The AppBuilder Tool Set

*Create, store, develop, build and test apps in the cloud without installing any additional dependencies*

[Telerik AppBuilder][AppBuilder] provides a wide range of IDE choices paired with storage, compile and build services in the cloud. If you have access to the Internet and a Telerik account, you can use AppBuilder to develop NativeScript apps without configuring any additional tools and SDKs for native development. Telerik AppBuilder takes your cross-platform  project, compiles and builds it in the cloud and produces a truly native app.

> **TIP:** If you are unfamiliar with the complexity of native development, you might want to try the AppBuilder tool set. It does not require additional tools and SDKs installed on your system.
