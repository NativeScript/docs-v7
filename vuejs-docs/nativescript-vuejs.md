# NativeScript with Vue.js

<a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> is a lightweight, ‘progressive framework’ for building user interfaces. NativeScript integrates with Vue.js to offer a standard way for building cross-platform native mobile apps. If you have used Vue.js before you’ll feel right at home with NativeScript-Vue.
