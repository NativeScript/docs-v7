## Router

In an Angular 2 application navigation is done using the **Angular Component Router**. You can check [this detailed guide on how to use the router](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html). From here on we are going to assume that you are familiar with the basic concepts and concentrate on the specifics when doing navigation with Angular 2 inside a NativeScript app. 

> Note: This article covers usage of the @angular/router v3. For the `deprecated beta router` please import `nativescript-angular/router-deprecated`.

## Configuration

The router configuration usually consists of the following steps:

Create a `RouterConfig` object which maps paths to components and parameters:
{%snippet router-config%}


Use the `NativeScriptRouterModule` API to import your routes:
{%snippet router-provider%}


As usual, pass your module to the `bootstrapModule` function to start your app:
{%snippet router-bootstrap%}

## Pages

NativeScript apps consist of pages which represent the separate application screens. Pages are instances of the [`Page`](http://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_page_.page.html) class. Page navigation integrates with the native navigation elements on the current platform (ex. the **Back** button in Android or the **NavigationBar** in iOS). 

> Note: You will rarely need to create Page instances manually. The framework creates pages automatically when bootstrapping or navigating the app. You can get a reference to the current page by injecting it into your component using the DI.

In NativeScript you have a choice between two router outlets:
* `router-outlet` - replaces the content of the outlet with different component. It is the default outlet that comes from Angular 2.
* `page-router-outlet` - uses pages to navigate. The new components are shown in a new page.

To show the difference between the to we are going to use the following components in the next examples:

{%snippet router-content-components%}

We are also going to use the following route configuration file (`app.routes.ts`):

{%snippet router-config-all%}


## Router Links

One thing you might have noticed in the code above is the `nsRouterLink` directive. It is similar to [`routerLink`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html#!#-routerlink-binding), but works with NativeScript navigation. To use it, you need to import `NativeScriptRouterModule` in your NgModule.

## Router Outlet

Let's take a look at the following example that uses `<router-outlet>`:

{%snippet router-outlet-example%}

The result is that with each navigation the content of the `router-outlet` is replaced with the new component:

![router-outlet-ios](../img/navigation-angular/outlet-ios.gif "RouterOutlet IOS")
![router-outlet-Android](../img/navigation-angular/outlet-android.gif "RouterOutlet Android")

## Page Router Outlet

Here is a similar example using the `page-router-outlet`:

{%snippet page-outlet-example%}

The main difference here is that when navigating - the new component will be loaded as a root view in a **new** `Page`. This means that any content *outside* the `page-router-outlet` will not be included in the new page. This is the reason why the `page-router-outlet` is usually the single root element in the application component. 

Here is the result:

![page-outlet-ios](../img/navigation-angular/page-outlet-ios.gif "PageRouterOutlet IOS")
![page-outlet-Android](../img/navigation-angular/page-outlet-android.gif "PageRouterOutlet Android")

Note that we can now use the **Back button** and the **NavigationBar** to navigate. 

It is possible to nest `<router-outlet>` component inside `<page-router-outlet>` or another `<router-outlet>`.

## Navigation Options

You can define the trigger in your application declaratively - using the `nsRouterLink` directive in your markup. Or you can do it through code - by injecting  the `RouterExtensions` class and using its methods:

{%snippet router-extensions-import%}

> Note: You can also use the stock Angular `Route` and `Location` classes to handle your navigation—`RouterExtensions` actually invokes those APIs internally. However, `RouterExtenstions` provides access to some NativeScript-specific features like clearing navigation history or defining page transitions.

### Navigating Back

You can navigate back using `back()` method of the `RouterExtensions`:

{%snippet router-back%}

You can also navigate back to the previous page with `backToPreviousPage()`:

{%snippet router-page-back%}

The difference between the two methods is visible when there are nested(child) router-outlet(s) inside the current page:

* `back()` - goes back to the previous router location even if the navigation occurred inside the child router outlet on the current page.
* `backToPreviousPage()` - goes back to the previous page. The method skips all child router-outlet navigations inside the current page and goes directly to the previous one. 


### Clearing Page Navigation History

In NativeScript's page navigation, you have the option to navigate to another page and clear the page navigation history. This means that the user will not be able to go back using the back button (or swipe back in iOS). This is useful in scenarios where you have a login page and you don't want users to be able go go back to it once logged in.

You can specify `clearHistory` as an attribute on your `nsRouterLink` tag in the markup:

{%snippet router-clear-history-link%}

Or you can use `RotuerExtensions` class:

{%snippet router-clear-history-code%}

### Specifying Page Transitions

By default, all navigation will be animated and will use the default transition for the respective platform (UINavigationController transitions for iOS and Fragment transitions for Android). To change the transition type, set the `pageTransition` attribute on your `nsRouterLink` tag in the markup:

{%snippet router-page-transition-link%}

> Note: You can set `pageTransition="none"` to disable the transition.

You can also do this through code using the `RotuerExtensions` class:

{%snippet router-page-transition-code%}

> Note: You can pass `animated: false` in `NavigationOptions` to disable the transition.

For other customization options check the [`NavigationTransition`](http://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/interfaces/_ui_frame_.navigationtransition.html) interface.

## Route Guards

You can use Angular’s [route guards](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html#!#guards) for even more control over the navigation. 

> **Note**: Currently, there is no way to prevent user-initiated back navigation - trying to apply guards in such scenario is not supported.
