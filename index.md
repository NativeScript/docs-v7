# Welcome to NativeScript

*Are you a hybrid app developer looking for a way to create truly native apps? Are you a native app developer wondering how to expand the scope of his apps to the other popular platforms? Or perhaps you are a web developer searching for a way to transfer your existing skills to the world of mobile development?*

NativeScript lets you develop truly native apps for iOS and Android from a single code base of JavaScript or TypeScript, XML and CSS. NativeScript takes your cross-platform code and translates it into the language that your target platform speaks.

## How Does It Work

Develop your business logic with **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**, design and style your user interface using **XML** and **CSS** and let NativeScript translate your single-source application code into truly native apps for iOS or Android.

You can develop for **Android 4.2 or later** and **iOS 7.1 or later**.

1. Write your **application code** once using the **NativeScript modules** and the **NativeScript runtimes**.<br/>The modules expose the native device and platform capabilities of Android and iOS in a consistent manner and let you access them via non-platform-specific code.<br/>The modules let you access some native capabilities via platform-specific JavaScript code.
1. Customize your app with platform-specific assets such as icons and splash screens.
1. Build your app.<br/>When you build your app, the **NativeScript runtime** translates your non-platform specific code to the native language of your target platform and the **NativeScript tools** use the native platform SDKs and tools to build a native application package.
1. Run your cross-platform native apps in the native emulators, on real devices or distribute them to testers and end users.
