# Welcome to NativeScript

Develop your business logic with **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**, design and style your user interface using **XML** and **CSS** and let NativeScript translate your single-source application code into truly native apps for iOS or Android.

You can develop for **Android 4.2 or later** and **iOS 7.1 or later**.
