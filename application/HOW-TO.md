# Application
The Application module provides abstraction over the platform-specific Application implementations.
It is the main BCL module and is required for other BCL modules to work properly.
The default bootstrap.js implementation for each platform loads and initializes this module.
``` JavaScript
var app = require("application");

```
The pre-required `app` module is used throughout the following code snippets.
### Initialization
``` JavaScript
// The native app instance depends on the target platform
var nativeAppInstance;
app.init(nativeAppInstance);

```
### Checking the target platform
Use the following code in case you need to check somewhere in your code the platform you are running against:
``` JavaScript
if (app.android) {
    // we are running on Android device
} else if (app.ios) {
    // we are running on iOS device
}

```
### Using the Android-specific implementation
Accessing the Android-specific object instance (will be undefined if running on iOS)
``` JavaScript
var androidApp = app.android;

```
Using the Android Application context
``` JavaScript
var context = app.android.context;

// get the Files (Documents) folder (directory)
var dir = context.getFilesDir();

```
Tracking the current Activity
``` JavaScript
if (androidApp.currentActivity === androidApp.startActivity) {
    // We are currently in the main (start) activity of the application
}

```
