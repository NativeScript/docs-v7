## Overview

An event is a message sent from an event emitter to signify the occurrence of a specific action. This action can be generated by a user action (such as a tap) or by program logic (for instance to indicate that downloading an image from a server has completed). The object that raises the event is called **event sender** or simply **sender**. The object that consumes the event is called **event listener** or simply **listener**.

Being a TypeScript (JavaScript) framework, NativeScript cannot benefit from a built in the language event handling mechanism. But because of the events' critical importance for modern mobile application development, NativeScript provides a class `Observable` that powers the process of working with events. Find more information about it in the [API Reference](./ApiReference/data/observable/observable.md).

## How Do Events Work

In general, events are very similar to a radio station: the **sender** plays music (fires an event) and the **listener** dances (executes an action).

To repeat, NativeScript streamlines handling events by providing a class called `Observable`. Because it is one of the base classes within the NativeScript framework, almost every NativeScript object (component) has an option for dealing with events.

## Adding an Event Listener

Adding an **event listener** means setting a function (method) that executes when the event is raised.

The examples below show how to set a function that prints a "Hello World!" message in the console to be executed when a button is tapped. You can choose between the shorthand syntax and the full syntax or you can declare the event handler in XML.

### Adding an Event Handler Using the Shorthand Syntax

Use the shorthand syntax to write an in-line function to be executed on an event (tapping a `testButton` in this example):

``` JavaScript
var buttonModule = require("ui/button");
var testButton = new buttonModule.Button();
testButton.text = "Test";

testButton.on(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap, function (eventData) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
});
```
``` TypeScript
import buttonModule = require("ui/button");
var testButton = new buttonModule.Button();
testButton.text = "Test";

testButton.on(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap, function (eventData) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
  });
```

###  Adding an Event Handler Using the Full Syntax
 
Even though the shorthand syntax is very handy when assigning simple functions, it is missing some important features available in the full syntax. For example, the following code adds a third optional parameter that represents the `this` argument. You use `this` as event handler context (closure). In other words, if you need the `this` argument in your event handler function you have to use the full syntax, otherwise the sender object is used as `this`.


``` JavaScript
var buttonModule = require("ui/button");
var testButton = new buttonModule.Button();
testButton.text = "Test";

var onTap = function (eventData) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
};

testButton.addEventListener(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap, onTap, this);
```
``` TypeScript
import buttonModule = require("ui/button");
var testButton = new buttonModule.Button();
testButton.text = "Test";

var onTap = function (eventData) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
};

testButton.addEventListener(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap, onTap, this);
```

### Adding an Event Handler in an XML Declaration

Another option to set an event handler is to use an XML declaration like this:

``` XML
<Page>
  <StackLayout>
    <Button tap="onTap" />
  </StackLayout>
</Page>
```
Naturally, you need a code behind file to write the function body (the code behind file has the same file name but a different extension: .js or .ts depending on the language you are using). It could look like this:

``` JavaScript
function onTap(eventData) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
exports.listViewItemTap = listViewItemTap;
```
``` TypeScript
export function onTap(eventData) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

## Removing an Event Listener

Under most circumstances you don't need to remove the event listener. If you do, however, for example if you want to receive the event just once or want to remove the event listener to free up resources, you can resort to the methods described in the sections below.

> There is no syntax to remove an event listener through an XML declaration.

### Removing an Event Listener Using the Shorthand Syntax

The following example uses the shorthand syntax to remove all listeners for the tap event of the testButton instance. If there are more than one event listener objects, you can set a second parameter with the name of the callback function. This way only the referenced event listener is removed.

``` JavaScript
testButton.off(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap);
```
``` TypeScript
testButton.off(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap);
```


### Removing an Event Listener Using the Full Syntax

The full syntax builds on top of the shorthand syntax by adding the `this` argument similarly to the full syntax for adding an event listener. It is useful when multiple event listeners with different `this` arguments are available.

``` JavaScript
testButton.removeEventListener(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap, onTap);
```
``` TypeScript
testButton.removeEventListener(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap, onTap);
```

## PropertyChange Event

The `Observable` class provides a built-in event called `propertyChange` which is called when a property is changed. This is how to subscribe to this event:

``` JavaScript
var observableModule = require("data/observable");
var observableObject = new observableModule.Observable();

observableObject.on(observableModule.knownEvents.propertyChange, function(propertyChangeData){
  console.log(propertyChangeData.propertyName + " has been changed and the new value is: " + propertyChangeData.value);
});
```
``` TypeScript
import observableModule = require("data/observable");
var observableObject = new observableModule.Observable();

observableObject.on(observableModule.knownEvents.propertyChange, function(propertyChangeData){
  console.log(propertyChangeData.propertyName + " has been changed and the new value is: " + propertyChangeData.value);
});
```
It is important to note that this event is critical for the entire [data binding](./bindings.md) system. To take advantage of the data binding mechanism, all you have to do is make your business object **inherit** the `Observable` class. The following example demonstrates how to do that:

``` JavaScript
var observableModule = require("data/observable");
var MyClass = (function (_super) {
  __extends(MyClass, _super);
  function MyClass() {
    _super.apply(this, arguments);
  }
  Object.defineProperty(MyClass.prototype, "myProperty", {
    get: function () {
      return this.get("myProperty");
      },
      set: function (value) {
        this.set("myProperty", value);
      },
      enumerable: true,
      configurable: true
    });
    return MyClass;
  })(observableModule.Observable);
exports.MyClass = MyClass;
```
``` TypeScript
import observableModule = require("data/observable");

export class MyClass extends observableModule.Observable {
  public get myProperty(): number {
    return this.get("myProperty");
  }

  public set myProperty(value: number) {
    this.set("myProperty", value);
  }
}
```
The pervious code snippet fires the `propertyChange` event when the property value is changed.

## Creating a Custom Event

If your business logic demands it, you may want to fire (raise or emit) a custom event on a particular action. To do that, call the `Observable.notify()` method when the action is completed. This method takes any **implementer** of the [EventData interface](./ApiReference/data/observable/EventData.md) as event data. It includes basic information about an event&mdash;its name as `eventName` and an instance of the event sender as `object`).

``` JavaScript
var eventData = {
  eventName: "myCustomEventName",
  object: this
};
this.notify(eventData);
```
``` TypeScript
var eventData: observableModule.EventData = {
  eventName: "myCustomEventName",
  object: this
}
this.notify(eventData);
```
The minimum information needed to raise an event is the `eventName`&mdash;it will be used to execute all event handlers associated with this event.

The next step is to hook to this event:

``` JavaScript
var myCustomObject = new MyClass();
myCustomObject.on("myCustomEventName", function(eventData){
  console.log(eventData.eventName + " has been raised! by: " + eventData.object);
})
```
A similar logic is implemented for the `propertyChange` event, so if your business logic requires that, `propertyChange` can be emitted manually through the `notify()` method (without using the `Observable.set()` method that also fires the `propertyChange` event).

## Avoiding Memory Leaks

Though the radio station comparison is convenient for understanding the concept, events are a bit more complicated on the inside. To be able to notify the listener, the sender contains a pointer to the listener. Even if you set the listener object to `null` or `undefined`, it is not eligible for garbage collection, because the sender is alive and has a live reference to the listener object. This could result in a memory leak when the object lifetimes of the sender and the listener differ significantly.

Consider this scenario: A UI element creates a lot of child controls, each of which hooks to an event of the parent. Then a child control is released (during a list view scrolling for instance), causing a memory leak.

To prevent these memory leaks, it is good practice to remove your event listener handler before releasing the listener object. Unfortunately, sometimes you can't determine the exact time to call the `off` or `removeEventListener` function. In such cases use another option of the NativeScript framework: Week Events.

## Working with Weak Events

A weak event, as its name suggests, creates an weak reference to the listener object, which helps you release the listener object without removing the event listener pointer.

### Adding a Weak Event Listener

Using weak event listeners is very similar to normal events. This is how to add a weak event listener (code comments are included for clarity):

``` JavaScript
var weakEventListenerModule = require("ui/core/weakEventListener");
var buttonModule = require("ui/button");
var observableModule = require("data/observable");

var testButton = new buttonModule.Button();
testButton.text = "Test";
testButton.on(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap, function () {
  source.set("testProperty", "change" + counter);
  });

  var source = new observableModule.Observable();

  var counter = 0;
  var handlePropertyChange = function () {
    counter++;
    this.text = counter + "";
  };

  var weakEL = weakEventListenerModule.WeakEventListener;
  var weakEventListenerOptions: weakEventListenerModule.WeakEventListenerOptions = {
    // create a weak reference to the event listener object
    targetWeakRef: new WeakRef(this),
    // create a weak reference to the event sender object
    sourceWeakRef: new WeakRef(this.source),
    // set the name of the event
    eventName: observable.knownEvents.propertyChange,
    // set the event handler
    handler: handlePropertyChange,
    // (optional) set the context in which to execute the handler 
    handlerContext: testButton,
    // (optional) set a specialized property used for extra event recognition 
    key: this.options.targetProperty
  }
  weakEL.addWeakEventListener(this.weakEventListenerOptions);
```
``` TypeScript
import weakEventListenerModule = require("ui/core/weakEventListener");
import buttonModule = require("ui/button");
import observableModule = require("data/observable");

var testButton = new buttonModule.Button();
testButton.text = "Test";
testButton.on(buttonModule.knownEvents.tap, function () {
  source.set("testProperty", "change" + counter);
});

var source = new observableModule.Observable();

var counter = 0;
var handlePropertyChange = function () {
  counter++;
  this.text = counter + "";
};

var weakEL = weakEventListenerModule.WeakEventListener;
var weakEventListenerOptions: weakEventListenerModule.WeakEventListenerOptions = {
  // create a weak reference to the event listener object
  targetWeakRef: new WeakRef(this),
  // create a weak reference to the event sender object
  sourceWeakRef: new WeakRef(this.source),
  // set the name of the event
  eventName: observable.knownEvents.propertyChange,
  // set the event handler
  handler: handlePropertyChange,
  // (optional) set the context in which to execute the handler
  handlerContext: testButton,
  // (optional) set a specialized property used for extra event recognition
  key: this.options.targetProperty
}
weakEL.addWeakEventListener(this.weakEventListenerOptions);
```

The previous example shows how to attach a weak event listener to an observable object instance. A closer look to the `handlePropertyChange` function shows that `text` property of the `this` object is changed when the `propertyChange` event is raised (via the button tap event). It demonstrates how to use the `handlerContext` property&mdash;its value is taken as an argument to `this` inside the event handler function.


### Removing a Weak Event Listener

The `targetWeakRef` and `key` properties are optional when invoking a function on an event. However, they allow for removing an event listener. The properties are used as keys for a key-value pair that stores weak event listeners.

``` JavaScript
weakEL.removeWeakEventListener(this.weakEventListenerOptions);
```
``` TypeScript
weakEL.removeWeakEventListener(this.weakEventListenerOptions);
```
