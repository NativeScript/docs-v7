# Set Up the NativeScript CLI on Windows

With the open-source [NativeScript Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli) and an IDE or text editor of your choice, you can create, develop, store and build your apps entirely locally, free of charge, without an Internet connection and anonymously.

On Windows systems, you can use the NativeScript CLI to develop only Android apps. This limitation is caused by the requirements for iOS development.
