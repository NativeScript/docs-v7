# Set Up the NativeScript CLI on OS X

With the open-source [NativeScript Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli) and an IDE or text editor of your choice, you can create, develop, store and build your apps entirely locally, free of charge, without an Internet connection and anonymously.

On OS X systems, you can use the NativeScript CLI to develop Android and iOS apps.
