#Running Latest Code

## Reasoning
Often, working with open-source projects, one needs functionality that has not yet passed the full release cycle, or even functionality that is not yet implemented. Building the source code is essential for the purpose. The statement is applicable for NativeScript as well. Accordng to the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), suggesting a fix involves testing the latest code.

## Behind the Curtains of Running a NativeScript Application

1. `npm install nativescript -g` - Node Package Manager (npm) downloads and installs the [NativeScript CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript)
2. `tns create [AppName]` - the NativeScript CLI downloads the [Hello-World template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-hello-world) and unpacks it to a folder, named after the app name you point out. At the same time the CLI installs the [NativeScript cross-platform modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-core-modules). As a result, your application folder now contains an `app` folder, holding the files of your application ([source code](https://github.com/NativeScript/template-hello-world)) and a `node_modules` folder, having the cross-platform modules ([source code](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript))
3. `tns platform add android/ios` - the NativeScript CLI downloads the latest SemVer-compatible version of the specified runtime, unpacks it and applies transformations to the native (Android Studio or xCode) project (e.g. changes the project name)
4. `tns run android/ios` - the NativeScript CLI copies the files under the `app` folder to the `platforms/[android/ios]/.../app` folder following a specific logic so that these get further used by a native build tool (*gradle*/*xcode-build*). As a next step, the NativeScript CLI executes compilation, deployment and run commands of *gradle* or *xcode-build*.
5. Any JavaScript code gets executed in a V8 or JavaScriptCore engine, embedded in the NativeScript runtimes. Each call to an actual native object gets marshalled via the runtimes to the underlying platform and vice-versa. The runtimes provide JavaScript handles to the native objects.

## Contents of the [NativeScript](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript) Repo

The NativeScript framework is built using TypeScript. For that, one of the build steps is TypeScript compilation, which uses TypeScript declarations of the underlying native objects. These are really large files ([android17.d.ts](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/blob/master/android17.d.ts) and [ios.d.ts](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/blob/master/ios.d.ts)). The TypeScript compilation with these two files loaded in memory takes a lot of time. To save development time and have as quick and stable feature output, the team decided to keep several important applications inside the same repository, so that all of them get compiled in a single pass.

Having said that, each subfolder of the [apps](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/tree/master/apps) subfolder of the repo represents a single application.

## Building the Repo
When the repo gets built, it outputs a bunch of packages (stripping the version- and extension- part of the filename for clarity):
- tns-core-modules - the package, containing the core modules. It gets distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-core-modules).
- tns-sample-* contain some test/demo applications the team use internally for testing
- tns-template-* have templates that will get used once we have the [template-selection functionality](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/374) implemented in the command-line interface

The repo gets built via the commands:

```Console
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt
```

## Using the Latest tns_modules

To use the latest tns_modules, simply
- build the repo
- navigate to your project folder
- delete the `tns-core-modules` folder from the `node_modules` subfolder of your project (i.e. `rm -rf node_modules/tns-core-modules` for Linux or `rd /S /Q node_modules\tns-core-modules`)
- install the newly built package (`npm install [PATH-TO-NATIVESCRIPT-REPO/bin/dist/tns-core-modules-x.x.x.tgz]`)

## Handling Internal Breaking Changes

It is possible that an internal breaking change gets introduced, involving an update to both the runtimes and the modules. An internal breaking change would mean that the public API of the tns_modules does not get affected, but a work in progress change in the runtimes requires a change in the internal code of the tns_modules themselves.

When such a case happens, the [ios](https://github.com/NativeScript/ios-runtime) and [android](https://github.com/NativeScript/android-runtime) runtimes must be built separately and updated via the CLI command of:
`tns platform update android/ios --frameworkPath=[Path-to-Runtime-Package]`

## Building the Runtimes
As the NativeScript framework gets distributed via npm, the runtimes are also packed as npm packages. For consistency reasons, the native builds (gradle/xcode-build) are wrapped by grunt builds, that do the job.

### Building the Android Runtime
The [android runtime](https://github.com/NativeScript/android-runtime) depends on the [android-metadata-generator](https://github.com/NativeScript/android-metadata-generator).

Provided you have all the dependencies set, the easiest way to have the android runtime built is clone the two repos to a single folder, so that the two are sibling folders, `cd` into the `android-runtime` folder and run:
```
gradle packar -PwidgetsPath=./widgets.jar
```

The resulting tns-android-x.x.x.tgz package will get created in the `dist` folder.

### Building the iOS Runtime

Follow the instructions on setting up the dependencies for building the [ios runtime](https://github.com/NativeScript/ios-runtime) in the repository README, then run `grunt package`.

The built tns-ios-x.x.x.tgx package will get created in the `dist` folder.
