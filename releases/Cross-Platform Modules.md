### Breaking changes
-  [(#774)](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/774) Animation class no longer has a **finished** property because an animation can be played multiple times. The **play** method now returns a new promise each time it is invoked. Use this to listen for the animation finishing or being cancelled. When upgrading to version 1.4.0 or above, simply remove **.finished** from your code.

**Old Code (JavaScript)**:
```JavaScript
animation1.play().finished.then(function () { console.log("Finished"); });
```
**New Code (JavaScript)**:
```JavaScript
animation1.play().then(function () { console.log("Finished"); });
```
**Old Code (TypeScript)**:
```JavaScript
animation1.play().finished.then(()=>console.log("Finished"));
```
**New Code (JavaScript)**:
```JavaScript

### Breaking changes
-  [(#242)](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/242) View and GesturesObserver classes have some breaking changes related to gesture operations


##1.0.0 (2015, April 29)

### New
* New options for camera module. Added a resizing options along with keep-aspect-ratio options. More information about how to use it can be found at the dedicated camera help article.
* First-file search order changed. Now package.json is searched first, then index.js and bootstrap.js is being searched last.

### Fixed
* Taking a full size picture in Android with NativeScript camera module.
* Pages no longer freeze on cancelling back-navigation via swipe gesture.
* Items having verticalAlignment set to center now have correct layout bounds.
* Camera for iOSs no longer throws a Null pointer error.
* iOS dialog OK button now appears last.

### Breaking changes
* `image-cache` now stores native image instances, i.e., `android.graphics.Bitmap` or `UIImage`. 
* `Image.src` property is now of type `any` and can accept either a string containing an image url or a native image instance.
* Gesture-related enum values changed to start with a small letter in order to be consistent with all other enums within NativeScript. For example, "gesturesModule.GestureType.Tap" should be used like "gesturesModule.GestureType.tap".
* `knownEvents` modules within all UI controls are removed and replaced with a static string values. In that case, all possible events will be visible through the inheritance tree. These static strings have an `Event` suffix. Every place where `viewModule.knownEvents.loaded` is used should be changed to `viewModule.View.loadedEvent` or `pageModule.Page.loadedEvent`. This change is relevant to code-behind only (xml declaration will not be affected).

##0.10.0 (2015, April 17)

### Fixed

### New

* In addition to binding converters introduced in version 0.42 static (global) place for most common converters is added. This place is named `application.resources`. More information about how to use it can be found in the special help topic: `Data binding`.

* Using plain objects (numbers, strings also an entire object) as binding context via `$value`. More information can be found at the dedicated `Data binding` help topic.

### Breaking changes

  * Image: `url` property renamed to `src`.
  * Image: `source` property renamed to `imageSource`.
  * TabView: `TabEntry` renamed to `TabViewItem`.
  * Module `local-settings` changed to `application-settings`. Only the name of the module is changed (API remains the same), hence the `require` statements must be updated, i.e., `require("local-settings")` should be changed to `require("application-settings")`.
