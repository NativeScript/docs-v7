# Introduction

Since the beginning of Angular (even back in the days when we were calling it Angular 2), you could use NativeScript with Angular to build mobile apps.

However, when you needed to build both a web and a native mobile app, you had to create two separate projects. However this has changed with the dawn of **Schematics** and **ng add**.

The Angular and NativeScript teams teamed up to create [nativescript-schematics](https://github.com/nativescript/nativescript-schematics), a schematic collection that enables you to build both web and mobile apps from a single project.

> **NOTE**: The **@nativescript/schematics** package only works with **@angular/cli: 6.1.0** or newer.

## Code-Sharing Projects

A code-sharing project is one where we keep the code for the web and mobile apps in one place. Hereâ€™s a quick diagram to show you what that looks like at a high level.

![project-structure](./img/project-structure.png?raw=true)

 The objective is to share as much code as possible, and split the platform-specific code into separate files.

This usually means that we can share the code for:

 * **Routes** for navigation,
 * **Services** for common business logic,
 *  and **Component Class definition** for common behaviour of a component

While, splitting the code for:

 * **UI Layer** (**CSS** and **HTML**) - as you need to use different user interface components in web and NativeScript-built native apps,
 * and **NgModules** - so that you can import platform-specific modules, without creating conflicts (e.g. Angular Material Design - which is web only) between web and mobile.

### Example: A Shopping Basket

For example in order to add a **shopping basket** to an online store, you would need:

* a **Basket Service**,
* a **Payment Service** and
* a **Basket Component**

Like in this diagram:

![basket-example](./img/basket.png?raw=true)

The **BasketService** - should allow you to:

* **loadItems** - get items placed in the basket
* **updateItemQuantity** - change the quantity of a given item in the basket
* **remove** - remove a given item from the basket

The **Basket Service** should be made of 100% shareable code

**basket.service.ts**

```TypeScript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

import { Item } from './item.model.ts';

@Injectable()
export class BasketService {

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }
  
  public loadItems(): Observable<Items[]> {
    return this.http.get('get-data-request');
  }

  public updateItemQuantity(itemId: number, quantity: number) {
    // update item quantity code
  }

  public remove(itemId: number) {
    // remove item code
  }
}
```

**payment.service.ts**

The **PaymentService** - should allow you to:

* **processOneClickPayment** - process a payment using user's default card

Again, the **PaymentService** should be made of 100% shareable code

```TypeScript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class PaymentService {
  public processOneClickPayment() {
    // Payment code
  }
}
```

Next, you would need to create a component, that would inject the **Basket** and the **Payment** services, and allow users to:

* see what is in the basket,
* update the quantity of its contents and
* buy the items.

One more time, the behaviour and the code of the **BasketComponent** should be 100% shared.

**basket.component.ts**

```TypeScript
@Component()
export class BasketComponent implements onInit {
  items$: Observable<Item[]>;
  
  constructor(
    basketService: BasketService,
    paymentService: PaymentService
  ) { }
  
  public ngOnInit() {
    this.items = this.basketService.loadItems();
  }

  public increaseQuantity(item: Item) {
    this.basketService.updateItemQuantity(item.id, item.quantity + 1);
  }

  public decreaseQuantity(item: Item) {
    if (item.quantity > 1) {
      this.basketService.updateItemQuantity(item.id, item.quantity - 1);
    } else {
      this.removeItem(item);
    }
  }
  
  public removeItem(item: Item) {
    this.basketService.remove(item.id);
  }
  
  public pay() {
    this.paymentService.processOneClickPayment();
  }
}
```

The final bit is the implementation of the view templates.
Both, templates should:

* display a list of items - their name and quantity,
* allow to increase or decrease the quantity of an item,
* remove an item and
* allow to process the payment

In this case the UI for the web and mobile apps is going to be different, and as a result the template code **cannot be shared**. However, everything underneath that drives its behaviour is still shared.

<!-- NEED a mock of both web and {N} screens HERE!!!-->

To create two separate templates, you just need to use a naming convention. Simply create two files:

* **basket.component.html** - the web template file,
* **basket.component.tns.html** - the NativeScript template file - it is the **.tns** that makes it a {N} file.

**basket.component.html**

```HTML
<div>
  <h1>Basket</h1>
  <div *ngFor="let item of items$ | async">
    <h3>{{ item.name }}</h3>
    <h4>{{ item.quantity }}</h4>
    <button (click)="increaseQuantity(item)">âž•</button>
    <button (click)="decreaseQuantity(item)">âž–</button>
    <button (click)="removeItem(item)">ðŸ—‘</button>
  <div>
  <button (click)="pay()">BUY NOWðŸ’°</button>
</div>
```

**basket.component.tns.html**

```HTML
<ActionBar title="Basket"></ActionBar>
<StackLayout>
  <ListView [items]="items$ | async">
    <ng-template let-item="item">
      <GridLayout columns="*, auto, auto, auto, auto">
        <Label [text]="item.name"></Label>
        <Label [text]="item.quantity" col="1"></Label>
        <Button [text]="âž•" (tap)="increaseQuantity(item)"></Button>
        <Button [text]="âž–" (tap)="decreaseQuantity(item)"></Button>
        <Button [text]="ðŸ—‘" (tap)="removeItem(item)"></Button>
      </GridLayout>
    </ng-template>
  </ListView>

  <Button text="BUY NOWðŸ’°" (tap)="pay()"></Button>
</StackLayout>
```

Even though, the contents of **basket.component.html** and **basket.component.tns.html** are not quite the same, you can see that in general they follow the same structure. Both use the **async pipe** to load the data from **items$** and both use the component methods (**increaseQuantity(item)**, **pay()**).
