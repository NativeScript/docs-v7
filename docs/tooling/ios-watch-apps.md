# iOS WatchOS Applications

From version 5.4 of the NativeScript CLI, an integration of [WatchOS](https://developer.apple.com/watchos/) application supports for your iOS mobile app created with NativeScript.

## Prerequisites

- **NativeScript CLI version 5.4** and above.
- NativeScript project.
- **Xcode 10** and above.
- Paired devices or simulators (**iPhone** with **iWatch** with **WatchOS 4.x/5.x** and above).
- WatchOS app created with **Objective-C** (Swift code [is **not** supported yet](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/4541#issuecomment-491202270)).

## WatchOS application in NativeScript.

To integrate your existing WatchOS application into your NativeScript project, execute the following steps:

**1.** Create **_Single View App_** from Xcode.

**2.** Add watch app target through **_File > New > Target > WatchKit App_**.

**3.** Add a name to your watch app, for example, **_MyFirstWatchApp_**.

**4.** Copy the generated **_MyFirstWatchApp_** and **_MyFirstWatchAppExtension_** to **_.../apps/MyApp/app/App_Resources/iOS/watchapp/MyFirstWatchApp_** and **_.../apps/MyApp/app/App_Resources/iOS/watchextension/MyFirstWatchAppExtension_** respectively.

**5.** Inside the **_Info.plist_** of the Watch App replace the value of **_`WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier`_** with **_`$(WK_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`_**.

**6.** Inside the **_Info.plist_** of the Watch Extension replace the value of **_`WKAppBundleIdentifier`_** with **_`$(WK_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`_**.

**7.** You can populate the **_Assets.xcassets_** of the Watch App and the Watch Extension and add the name of the **_`appiconset`_** to the **_.../apps/MyApp/app/App_Resources/iOS/watchapp/MyFirstWatchApp/watchapp.json_** and **_.../apps/MyApp/app/App_Resources/iOS/watchextension/MyFirstWatchApp Extension/extension.json_** respectively:

    ```JSON
    {
        "assetcatalogCompilerAppiconName": "AppIcon"
    }
    ```

**8.** You can modify the **_`WATCHOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`_** of the Watch App by adding the value inside the **_watchapp.json _** file like this:

    ```JSON
    {
        "assetcatalogCompilerAppiconName": "AppIcon",
        "targetBuildConfigurationProperties": {
            "WATCHOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET": 4.1
        }
    }
    ```
**9.** Build & Run the NativeScript application.

    ```Shell
    tns run ios
    ```

**10.** The application will be deployed and started on your iOS device/simulator. Make sure that the test iPhone is already paired with the testing iWatch. Once the iOS app starts, the Watch app will be automatically deployed on the testing iWatch device.
