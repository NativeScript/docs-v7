# Extend your existing iOS app with NativeScript

> **WARNING**: Embedding NativeScript into an existing iOS application is an experimental feature. If you’re interested in seeing this scenario being officially supported, please [let us know on GitHub](https://github.com/NativeScript/ios-runtime/issues/459).

If you have an existing native iOS app built with Swift/Objective-C, but would like to extend functionality of the app with NativeScript, we can provide experimental guidance for you.

## Requirements
 - Xcode 9+
 - NativeScript CLI 3.0+
    - Nativescript iOS platform 3.0+

## Instructions

Detailed instructions on embedding NativeScript in an existing iOS app are [available in this repository](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-ios-embedded).
