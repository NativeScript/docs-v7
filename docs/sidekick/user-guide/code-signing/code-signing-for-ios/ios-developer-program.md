# The iOS Developer Program

To be able to code sign your iOS apps, you need to obtain a certificate, an App ID and a provisioning profile. To create certificates, App IDs and provisioning profiles, you need to enroll in the Apple iOS Developer Program or the Apple iOS Developer Enterprise Program, if you are not already enrolled.

To enroll as an individual or a company, go to the [iOS Developer Program portal](https://developer.apple.com/programs/). Click **Enroll** and follow the instructions. If you do not have an Apple ID, you will be prompted to create one.

If you have received an invitation to join a development team which is already registered for the Apple iOS Developer Program or the Apple iOS Developer Enterprise Program, you need to follow the link you received and complete the instructions provided by Apple. If you do not have an Apple ID, you will be prompted to create one.

After you enroll in the Apple iOS Developer Program or the Apple iOS Developer Enterprise Program, you can log in the [iOS Dev Center](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter). From there, you can create and manage certificates, App IDs, registered devices and provisioning profiles.
