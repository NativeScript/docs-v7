# Log In or Log Out in {{ site.sk }}

To use the {{ site.ns-sk }} client and have access to the cloud services, you first need to authenticate. When you run {{ site.sk }}, you will be prompted to provide your Telerik login credentials or select a third-party login provider. {{ site.sk }} supports the following third-party login providers:

* Facebook
* Google
* Yahoo!
* Live ID
* GitHub

> When you log in for the first time through a third-party login provider, which email is not connected to an existing Telerik account, {{ site.sk }} creates a new Telerik account tied to the same email for you.

## Procedure

1. Run the {{ site.ns-sk }} client.
1. If prompted to log in, provide your Telerik credentials and click **Log in** or select your preferred third-party login provider.
1. (Optional) If you do not have a Telerik account, you can create one for free by clicking on the **Resister for FREE!** link.
1. To log out, hover on the account drop-down menu in the top right corner to expand it and click **Logout**.
