## What are {{ site.ns }} plugins

The {{ site.ns }} plugins are npm packages with some added native functionality. They can be referenced in your application as `dependencies` or as `devDependencies`. 

The `dependencies` are plugins required by your app at run time. There are a lot of plugins that you can use as dependencies, including, but not limited to plugins that introduce an UI component (calendar, drop-down, picker), plugins that give you access to a native API (camera, geolocation), plugins that allow you to use a third-party SDK (Kinvey, Google Maps, Facebook). 

The `devDependencies` are the plugins or npm packages required by your app only during the development phase. Usually, those are plugins that introduce functionality like unit testing, TypeScript to JavaScript transpilation, obfuscation, to name a few.    

## The {{ site.ns }} Marketplace

Progress manages the [NativeScript Marketplace](https://market.nativescript.org/), a collection of free to use NativeScript plugins that can easily be integrated in your native mobile app. 

Some of the plugins are marked as `verified`, which means that they are created and maintained by Progress or trusted partners and satisfy a [long list of criteria](https://github.com/NativeScript/marketplace-feedback/blob/master/docs/verified-plugins.md). The verified plugins are high in quality and reliability and are always kept up-to-date with the latest versions of {{ site.ns }}.

## {{ site.ns }} plugins in {{ site.sk }}

In {{ site.sk }}, you can easily find, install, update and remove plugins, both as `dependencies` and as `devDependencies`. Plugins installed as `devDependencies` are marked with the `dev` tag and the green `verified` tag indicates that a plugin is verified.
