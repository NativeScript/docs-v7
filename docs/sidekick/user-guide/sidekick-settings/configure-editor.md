# Configure Code Editor

Before you can use the **Open in Editor** button to open your app directly in your preferred code editor, you need to configure it properly. To do this, you need to provide a valid path to the executable of your favorite code editor. 

## Procedure

1. Launch {{ site.ns-sk }}.
1. Click on the settings icon, which is located in the top right corner.
1. In the **Settings** view, select the **Code Editor** section.
1. In the **Path to executable** text box, click **Browse** and select the executable of your preferred code editor.
1. (Optional) In the **Command line arguments** text box, provide parameters that will be passed to the code editor when it is launched. 
1. Click **Save**.
1. In the main view of {{ site.ns-sk }}, click **Open in Editor** to open the code of your application directly in the previously selected editor.
