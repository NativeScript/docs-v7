# RadChart Bar Series
Bar Series are categorical type of series that represent the objects from the data source as bars with different length. To use Bar series, you need to initialize a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}, define a {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis %} and {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis %} and bind the series to a set of data objects.

## Adjusting Bar Size
By default, the size of a bar is calculated based on the axis plot mode and the count of the categories from the data source. There are cases in which the automatically calculated size does not meet the specific application scenarios. By using the {% typedoc_link classes:BarSeries,member:minBarSize %} and {% typedoc_link classes:BarSeries,member:maxBarSize %} properties you can adjust the size of a single bar within the series. The properties accept values in device independent pixels. These properties define boundaries for the size of a bar.

### Example
The following definition represents the data context that will be used to populate the Bar series with data:

<snippet id='categorical-source'/>

Note that since the bar chart shows categories, each category must be unique. In the above example, the category is 'Country'. Including the same category more than once would result in some data not being displayed.

We use an instance of this model to assign it as the `bindingContext` of the page we have put our Bar series on:

<snippet id='binding-context-bar-series'/>

And finally, in the XML definition of the page we put a RadCartesianChart, add a BarSeries instance to it and bind the series to the source of data:

<snippet id='bar-series'/>

> Depending on the required Bar orientation, you can swap the axes' position and assign the Categorical to the *horizontalAxis* property and the Linear to the *verticalAxis* property. This will change the orientation of the bars to vertical.
