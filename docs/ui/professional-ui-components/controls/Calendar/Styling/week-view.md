# Calendar Week View Styling

The Week view mode practically is the same as Month view mode, that's why the same rules and requirements for [Month view styling]({% slug calendar-monthview-styling %} "Read more about styling in Month view mode") are applicable.
In order to apply custom style for this mode, you need to initialize the `weekViewStyle` property of `RadCalendar` with instance of `CalendarWeekViewStyle`.
