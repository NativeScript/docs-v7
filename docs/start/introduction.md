# Getting Started With NativeScript

NativeScript is how you build cross-platform, native iOS and Android apps without web views. Use Angular, TypeScript or modern JavaScript to get truly native UI and performance while reusing the skills and the code from your web projects. Get 100% access to native APIs via JavaScript and reuse of packages from npm, CocoaPods and Gradle. Open source and backed by Progress.

# Getting Started With NativeScript and Angular

NativeScript doesn’t require [Angular](https://angular.io/), but it’s even better when you use it. You can fully reuse skills and code from the web to build beautiful, high performance native mobile apps without web views. NativeScript features deep integration with Angular, the latest and greatest (and fastest) JavaScript framework. Open source and backed by Progress.

Ready to get started developing with NativeScript? Here are your next steps.

## Step #1: NativeScript Playground

NativeScript Playground is a browser-based environment for getting started with NativeScript fast. Playground offers a set of comprehensive tutorials that walk you through building a real-world iOS and Android app from scratch.

{% angular %}
<p><a href="https://play.nativescript.org/?template=groceries-ng&tutorial=groceries-ng" class="ns-button -action">Start Tutorial</a></p>
{% endangular %}

{% nativescript %}
<p><a href="https://play.nativescript.org/?template=groceries-js&tutorial=groceries-js" class="ns-button -action">Start Tutorial</a></p>
{% endnativescript %}

## Step #2: Install the NativeScript Command-Line Interface

Once you have the basics of NativeScript down in Playground, you need to set up a local development environment that lets you build and test your apps locally. To do that you’ll want to go through our documentation on installing the NativeScript command-line interface.
