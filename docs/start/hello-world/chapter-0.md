# Getting Started

Welcome to the NativeScript Getting Started Guide. In this tutorial you'll use NativeScript, a cross-platform JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps, to build an iOS and Android app from scratch.

## What is NativeScript?

  <p><a href="https://www.nativescript.org/">NativeScript</a> is a free and open source framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and CSS. NativeScript renders UIs with the native platform’s rendering engine—no <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-webview/">WebViews</a>—resulting in native-like performance and UX.</p>

NativeScript provides a best-of-both-worlds development experience. The NativeScript cross-platform JavaScript modules give you the convenience of writing iOS and Android apps from a single JavaScript codebase, while the NativeScript runtimes give you the power of accessing native APIs, SDKs, and frameworks when you need them—all without needing to open Xcode or Android Studio.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and your development machine’s terminal. More specifically:

* **JavaScript**: You should know basic JavaScript concepts, such as how functions, if statements, and loops work.
* **CSS**: You should know how to write simple CSS selectors, and know how to apply CSS rules as name/value pairs.
* **The terminal**: You should know how to open a terminal or command-line prompt on your development machine, how to change directories, and how to execute commands.
* **A text editor or IDE**: You should know the basics of your text editor or IDE of choice. You can use any text editor to build NativeScript apps.

## Installation

In order to start this tutorial you need to have the NativeScript CLI (command-line interface) installed on your development machine, which you can do using the link below.

* [Complete the NativeScript installation guide](/start/quick-setup)

> **TIP**: Setting up your machine for native development can be tricky, especially if you’re new to mobile development. Here are a few tips you might find useful.
> * You can [complete a version of this tutorial in NativeScript Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/?template=groceries-js&tutorial=groceries-js). NativeScript Playground is a browser-based environment that lets you develop apps without needing to configure your local development environment.
> * [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick) is a one-click setup experience for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Sidekick installs the NativeScript CLI and required dependencies for macOS and Windows - and offers starter kits, cloud-based builds for iOS and Android, and app store publishing. Install Sidekick and resume your tutorial with the CLI pre-installed for you.
> * If you get stuck going through the installation process, the [NativeScript community forum](https://discourse.nativescript.org/c/getting-started) is a great place to get help.

With that out of the way, let’s get started building apps with NativeScript!
