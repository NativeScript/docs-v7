# NativeScript Advanced Setup: Linux

This page contains a list of all system requirements needed to build and run NativeScript apps on Linux, as well as a guided walkthrough for getting these requirements in place.

> **NOTE**: On Linux systems you can only use the NativeScript CLI to develop Android apps. This is because the NativeScript CLI uses Xcode to build iOS apps, which is only available on the macOS operating system. If you’re interested in building iOS apps on Linux, you may want to try out the public preview of [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick). NativeScript Sidekick provides robust tooling for NativeScript apps, including a service that performs iOS and Android builds in the cloud, removing the need to complete these system requirements, and allowing you to build for iOS on Linux.

## System Requirements

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* The latest stable official release of Node.js (LTS) [10.x](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/) 
* G++ compiler
* JDK 8
* Android SDK
* Android Support Repository
* (Optional) Google Repository
* Android SDK Build-tools 28.0.3 or a later stable official release

You must also have the following two environment variables setup for Android development:

* JAVA_HOME
* ANDROID_HOME

## Advanced Setup Steps

Complete the following steps to set up NativeScript on your Linux development machine:

1. Install the latest Node.js [10.x](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/) stable official release. 

2. If you are running on a 64-bit system, install the runtime libraries for the ia32/i386 architecture.

    <pre class="add-copy-button"><code class="language-terminal">sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0 libstdc++6:i386
    </code></pre>
    If you encounter an error showing "Unable to locate package lib32bz2-1.0" then use
    <pre class="add-copy-button"><code class="language-terminal">sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 libbz2-1.0:i386 libstdc++6:i386
    </code></pre>
    Package `lib32ncurses5` is only available as version 6 on Ubuntu >v.19.04, replace with `lib32ncurses6`. 

3. Install the G++ compiler.

    <pre class="add-copy-button"><code class="language-terminal">sudo apt-get install g++
    </code></pre>

4. Set up [JDK 8] [JDK 8](https://openjdk.java.net/install/).
    1. Run the following commands.

        <pre class="add-copy-button"><code class="language-terminal">
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
        </code></pre>

    2. After installation if you have multiple installations of java you can choose which to use:

        <pre class="add-copy-button"><code class="language-terminal">sudo update-alternatives --config java
        </code></pre>

    3. Set the JAVA_HOME system environment variable. Open `~/.bashrc` and add the following:

        <pre class="add-copy-button"><code class="language-terminal">export JAVA_HOME=$(update-alternatives --query javac | sed -n -e 's/Best: *\(.*\)\/bin\/javac/\1/p')</code></pre>  
        You may need to reload the `bashrc`file either by logging out and in again, or by running `source .bashrc` in the terminal from your Home directory.  

5. Install the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
    1. Go to [Android Studio and SDK Downloads](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other) and in the **SDK Tools Only** section download the package for Linux at the bottom of the page.
    2. After the download completes, unpack the downloaded archive into a folder, such as `/usr/local/android/sdk`
       * The archive you just extracted was the `tools` folder, so in this case it would be at: `/usr/local/android/sdk/tools`
    3. Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable. Open `~/.bashrc` and add the following:
        <pre><code class="language-terminal">export ANDROID_HOME="/usr/local/android/sdk/"
       export PATH="${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}tools/:${ANDROID_HOME}platform-tools/"</code></pre>
    4. In a text file which was opened, paste in the path to your variable (at the new line).
    
    For example: `ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/android/sdk`
        <blockquote><b>NOTE</b>: This is the directory that contains the <code>tools</code> (just installed) and <code>platform-tools</code> (installed by scripts in the next step) directories.</blockquote>
     1. Logout from current user and login again so environment variables changes take place.

6. Install all packages for the Android SDK Platform 28, Android SDK Build-Tools 28.0.3 or later, Android Support Repository, Google Repository and any other SDKs that you may need. You can alternatively use the following command, which will install all required packages. In order to install SDK's go to Android Studio -> Settings -> System Settings -> Android SDK -> Mark all the Android versions you would like to support within your project (The API Level column indicates the SDK Platform).

    <pre class="add-copy-button"><code class="language-terminal">sudo $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager "tools" "emulator" "platform-tools" "platforms;android-28" "build-tools;28.0.3" "extras;android;m2repository" "extras;google;m2repository"
    </code></pre>

7. Setup Android Emulators (AVD) by following the article [here]({%slug android-emulators%})
    1. After creating an emulated device you need to:
        * Enable its Developer mode - go to _Settings -> About emulated device_ and tap 7 times on _Build number_
        * Enable USB debugging - go to _Settings -> Developer options_ and enable USB Debugging 

8. Install the NativeScript CLI.
    1. Run the following command.

    <pre class="add-copy-button"><code class="language-terminal">sudo npm install nativescript -g --unsafe-perm
    </code></pre>

    1. Restart the command prompt.

9. To check if your system is configured properly, run the following command.

    <pre class="add-copy-button"><code class="language-terminal">tns doctor
    </code></pre>

If you see "No issues were detected" you are good to go!
