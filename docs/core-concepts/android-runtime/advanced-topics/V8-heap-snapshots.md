# Deprecated

> **NOTE**: `nativescript-dev-android-snapshot` plugin is deprecated. The recommended approach for using V8 Heap Snapshot feature in the context of NativeScript is via [`nativescript-dev-webpack` plugin](https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/bundling-with-webpack#v8-heap-snapshot) in combination with the `--snapshot` flag.
