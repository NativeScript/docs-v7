# Overview

Since NativeScript for Android embeds a JavaScript virtual machine (namely [Google's V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/)) to process the JavaScript code, it also takes advantage of the debugger tools available for this virtual machine - the [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/index).

> The article assumes that you are familiar with [JavaScript debugging in the Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging). You will need the Chrome web browser installed locally.

The current implementation supports two major scenarios:

  * Start debugging - starts an application with the debugger enabled
  * Attach/Detach debugger - attach/detach the debugger to a running application

# Start an application with the debugger attached

The following command will build, deploy and run the application with the debugger attached:

```bash
tns debug android
```
Behind the scenes the `debug` command will build and start the target application and then it will find an available port and enable V8's debugger on that port. Finally, you'll get a url starting with `chrome-devtools://` to copy/paste into Chrome to start the debug session.

# Features

 - Breakpoint debugging, stepping
 - *Inline* source maps support for transpiled code
 - Console evaluation


# Setting breakpoints in JavaScript
The global `debugger` sets a V8 breakpointIn the script source. It is equivalent to setting a "manual" breakpoint in the Sources tab of Chrome DevTools.

> See [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger) for more information.

# Attach the debugger

If you have a running application you can attach the debugger with the following command:

```bash
tns debug android --start
```

> As in the previous scenario, the `debug` command will configure the V8 debugger port, forward the port, and output a url to paste into Chrome. 

# Detach the debugger

Detaching the debugger is as simple as closing the chrome-devtools tab.

# Notes

> The current implementation has hard-coded 30 seconds timeout for establishing a connection between the command line tool and the device/emulator.


> Debugging sources different than JavaScript (TypeScript, CoffeeScript, etc.) is only possible when source maps are inlined by the transpiler.
